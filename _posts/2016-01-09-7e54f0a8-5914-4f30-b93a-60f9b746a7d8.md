# Training starts in 2016 -- 11 January at 6:30pm

Happy New Year!  We hope all the students of Kodomon Karate-Do, including their families, had a wonderful Christmas break, and we wish you all the best for the coming year.

Kagami Biraki kicks off our training for the new year.  This is our first night back, and will be held on 11 January 2016 at 6:30pm in the Alexandra Hills Community Hall (please note the change in time for those that usually train at 6pm -- classes are back to normal from Thursday).

This night will involve a joint training session, with both adults and children training together for an hour -- it will be a fairly light session, to ease back into training after some time off.  After training we will have some drinks and nibblies to welcome each other back.

As a reminder, our weekly training calendar is as follows: (**NOTE**: There are some changes to this weekly schedule. Sensei will explain these at Kagami Biraki)

Our annual events calendar has also been updated, showing all upcoming events -- this can be found here --[ANNUAL EVENTS CALENDAR.][0]

We encourage all students, past and present to come along and join in -- start the new year by forming some great habits!
